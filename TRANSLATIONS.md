# How to translate

In order to translate this program, you need the gettext package installed.  
If you have a github account, fork this repository.  
Go into the po folder locally and run 'msginit'.  
This should produce a 'LL.po' file, where 'LL' is the configured language your system is running.  
Use a po file editor, such as Poedit or Lokalize, and translate the 'msgid' strings on the 'msgstr' lines inside the quotes.  
You can then create a 'pull request' following github instructions.  
  
To make corrections to an existing LL.po file, you can open the file with a po editor like poedit, make the change and save it.  
Again a pull request may be submitted.
